# Topics Outline

## Preliminary Material

- exponential and logarithmic properties
- transformations of functions
- trig?

## Unit 1: Limits

### Definitions of Limits

- epsilon-delta definition introduction
  - discussion of distance
- working definition of limits
  - "arbitrarily close" vs "sufficiently close"
- graphical and numerical approximations

### Properties of Limits

- use limits of constant and identity functions to build up class of polynomial and rational functions
- square root limit exists at 0
- indeterminate forms, algebraic manipulation, don't care about domain of function

### Computing Limits

- use ideas of closeness to get a sense of what's happening with absolute values, square roots, etc.
- Squeeze Theorem: sin(x)/x and (cos(x)-1)/x

### Infinite Limits

- graphical and then sign argument
- rational and transcendentals

### Limits at Infinity

- power functions, polynomials, rationals, transcendentals

### Continuity

- composition of limits into continuous functions
- IVT

### Formal Definition

- epsilon/delta definition again
- formal definition of continuity
- formal definition of infinite limit or limit at infinity (show large value N idea)

## Unit 2: Derivative Rules

### Introduction to the Derivative and Definitions

- limit definition
- motivation
- dy/dx notation should come early

### Properties of the Derivative

- exponentials?
  - When do they need to be introduced? I think later.

### Interpretations of the Derivative

- maybe this is where the differential notation shows up?
- do we interpret differentials in general here?
- position, velocity, acceleration

### Product and Quotient Rule

- Product rule: include standard proof but also geometric intuition
- Quotient rule: proof by product rule

### Trigonometric Derivatives

- trig identity for sine/cosine

### Chain Rule

- Intuition: compare rates of change in a race, and interlocking gears
- x^x by using exponential and logarithmic composition (logarithmic differentiation later)
- lots of combinations of things/functions types/rules

### Implicit Differentiation

- make note again of d/dx notation and how that informs chain rule
- logarithmic differentiation

### Inverse Functions

- can this come earlier?

### Related Rates

- pitch as a purely application of implicit differentiation

## Unit 3: Derivative Analysis

### Absolute Extrema

- critical numbers
- EVT
- what about open intervals?
  - shows us that we need to test to see local extrema

### First Derivative Analysis

- main goal is to find local extrema
  - Rolle's Theorem -> MVT
- FDT, use IVT to test intervals

### Second Derivative Analysis

- inflection points
  - examples: point of diminishing returns, user base increase, etc.
- SDT

### Curve-Sketching

- how much of this do I actually care about?

### Optimization

- what examples should I show?
  - cut corners of rectangle to make box
  - fit rectangle under a graph
  - volume/surface area of a soda can
  - something with a closed interval and the wrong type of local extrema
    - story of military bomber and weight distribution

### Linear Approximation

- concavity to check over-/under-approximation
- some kind of error bound, or discussion of accuracy at least

### L'Hopital's Rule

- 0/0, infinity/infinity
- exponential stuff is important

### Newton's Method

- what about secant method?
- can I include some calculators or something?
- accuracy discussion

## Unit 4: Antiderivatives and Integrals

### Antiderivatives

- constant comes from MVT
- graphical interpretation

### Indefinite Integrals

- purely notational changes
- dx interpretation

### Definite Integrals

- purely definition and properties
- can we use some geometry

### Riemann Sums

- Left, Right approximations
- closed forms of some sums
  - Gauss sum, etc.
- limit of sum

### Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

- essentially this is all the proof
- average height of function

### Substitution

- show lots of types:
  - basic
  - fixing coefficients
  - turn around
  - clever ones
  - multiple rounds of substitution
